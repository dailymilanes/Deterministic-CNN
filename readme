# Deterministic-CNN

Shallow Convolutional Network evaluated on database 2a and database 2b from BCI Competition IV, 2008 and on dataset IVa from BCI Competition III
Data contains the preprocessed databases in format .mat
Preprocessing:
Band-pass filter from 4-38 Hz.
Exponential moving standardization with a decay factor of 0.999, to compute μ(ti) mean and variance σ^2(ti) in each trial.
The data x was normalized by (x-μ(ti))/σ(ti)
Rectify outliers, limited to μ(ti) ± 6σ(ti)
