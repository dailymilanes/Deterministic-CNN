# Deterministic-CNN

Shallow Convolutional Network evaluated on database 2a and 2b from BCI Competition IV 2008, and on dataset IVa from BCI Competition III 2004
Data contains the preprocessed databases in format .mat
Preprocessing:
Band-pass filter from 4-38 Hz.
Exponential moving standardization with a decay factor of 0.999, to compute μ(ti) mean and variance σ^2(ti) in each trial.
The data x was standardized by (x(ti)-μ(ti))/σ(ti)
Rectify outliers, limited to μ(ti) ± 6σ(ti)
